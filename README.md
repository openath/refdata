Reference data samples for athletics

This is a place to put data files while the long-term home, format and publishing process are being agreed, starting in October 2018.    OpenTrack aim to export information here on:
 - competitions
 - venues
 - organisations (including leagues, federations and clubs)
 - people, to the extent that privacy guidelines permit
 
 It's not currently intended to 'be a database', just a way to get files and schemas up there for people to discuss
